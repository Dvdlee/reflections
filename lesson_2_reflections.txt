What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When you initialize a repository using "git init" you are creating an empty Git repository in that directory. This is for future use when you add files that git should save the history of. I believe the .git contains the history of all the files in there. One needs to do it in order to create a repository that saves on to Git. You can do this offline/online it doesn't matter. Git doesn't make any commits initially without you because how else would you write comments then? Git gives you so much more control then other version-control programs, supposedly.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in that the repository is inside the working directory and the insides fo the working directory consist of the repository BUT the repository does not consist of all of the working directory. The value I believe that it offers is that you can have multiple repositories stored in one working directory.
